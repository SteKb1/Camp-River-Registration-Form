# Camp-River-Registration-Form
This is a project as part of my Udemy course.
So far i gave learnt html and basic CSS.

Ahhh...Summertime! Camp Feather River has hired to you to put their camper registration form online. 
They have the exact fields and text they need– but it’s in PDF form.
You’ll need to use the existing PDF and create a web page that is usable and correct with the exact 
fields specified in the PDF. You can abbreviate the text content at the end of the form for convenience, 
but, all the fields must be there.
